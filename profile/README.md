# C++ libraries for single-cell analysis

This organization contains bits and pieces of C++ code for single-cell analysis.
Most of this was originally taken from the [**scran** R package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/scran), with some refactoring to enable re-use outside of R.

Developers can check out the [**scran-cli**](https://github.com/libscran/scran-cli) repository to see how the various **libscran** components fit together.
For actual analyses, users are referred to the [R](https://github.com/libscran/scrapper), [Python](https://github.com/libscran/scranpy) or [Javascript](https://github.com/kanaverse/scran.js) bindings.
